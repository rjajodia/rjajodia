Hi, I’m Rhea Jajodia!
I'm a sophomore CS major at the University of Maryland.
- I’m interested in learning more about data science, cybersecurity and ML
- I'm currently learning OCaml
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects using C/C++, Python, or Java, specifically anything related to music, language, social justice, or environmental science

You can reach out to me by email at rjajodia@terpmail.umd.edu :)
